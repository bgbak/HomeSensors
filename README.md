# HomeSensors

A little project using Wemos D1 with DHT and battery shields to monitor temperature and humidity around the house.

Devices send measurement data to an MQTT broker.  
A small python script subscribes to the topics, and stores measurement values in InfluxDB.  
Grafana uses the InfluxDB as datasource.
